The main purpose of this project is to eliminate the old paper work of student
attendance which is usually a time consuming and not much secure process.

Now, mobile will be beneficial for the attendance which makes the proper use of it.

This project has a new concept of attendance by mobile rather than face
recognition and finger print.And attendance will be taken with the help of mobile location.
